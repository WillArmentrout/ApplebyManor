							<p>Bible Study is on Tuesday evenings at Crooked Creek at 6:30 p.m</p>
							
							<p>Our property committee and volunteers are working diligently to repair not only the lights in the gym but also the ceiling and lights in the Sunday School rooms in the basement.  We would like to restore those rooms to a bright, safe and inviting condition so that we can begin having Sunday School and VS there again. If you would like to donate to these two very important projects, please designate "property repair projects" on your check or envelope. Thank you. </p>
							
							<p>The gymnasium in Todd Manor Hall receives a great deal of use from members of our community, providing a wonderful service and generating extra income for our church.  Many of the lights in the gym ceiling are broken and beyond repair. A fund is being set up to collect monies to replace the old lighting with more economical and practical lights.  If you wish to donate, please designate "gym light fund" on your check or one of the pew envelopes. Thank you!</p>
							
							<p>Presbyterian Men's Group- The Men are still collecting aluminum cans for recycling.  Calling all men of the church to be a part of this group!  If interested please contact Doug Bartosh or contact the church office.  </p>
							
							<p>Printer cartridges are being collected to turn in at Staples for a 2 dollar credit to be used for office supplies.  A box will be under the table by the door in the back of the church. </p>
							
							<p>FOOD BANK NEEDS YOUR HELP: The Ford City Food Bank needs help with unloading and storing food on the last Tuesday of each month.  Help is needed for approximately an hour starting at 7:30 a.m. at Ford Memorial Methodist Church.  Please help if you can. Also, the Food Bank needs volunteers with pickup trucks to help go collect the food for the food bank.  This is done on the last Wednesday of the month. If you are able to help please contact Grace Woodside or Paul Kovacik. </p>
							
							<p>Building Repair Fund Day will be held the first Sunday of every month.  "Special Building Fund Day" envelopes are at the church for your donation.  Thank you for supporting our Building Fund. </p>
							
							<p>Quilters are needed, so if you would like to have a Wednesday out from 8:30 to 1 p.m., bring your lunch, a thimble that fits your middle finger, and have fun quilting!  At least three more quilters are needed.  Please call Karen Buzard at 724-763-8798</p>
							
							<p>Flowers for Sunday Worship 2018 calendar is posted on the bulletin board in the Council Room.  Sign up now for your special dates!  The cost is $35 per Sunday. You are welcome to take your flowers home with you after worship; empty coffee cans are available in the kitchen for your convenience. If you have ordered flowers and do not want to take them with you, please let Louise Jackson know. </p>
							
							<p>The local Food Bank especially needs these items:  bar soap, toilet tissue. </p>
							
							<p>Remember our military men and women for their selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need.</p>
